#Letâ€™s write a query that returns three columns:
1. The hours of the timestamp
2. The average score for each hour
3. The count of stories for each hour

SELECT strftime('%H', timestamp) AS "HOURS",
  AVG(score),
  COUNT(*)
FROM hacker_news
GROUP BY 1
LIMIT 20;

#Edit a few things in the previous query:
1. Round the average scores (ROUND()).
2. Rename the columns to make it more readable (AS).
3. Add a WHERE clause to filter out the NULL values in timestamp.

SELECT strftime('%H', timestamp) AS "HOURS",
  ROUND(AVG(score),0) AS "AVERAGE SCORE",
  COUNT(*) AS "STORIES FOR EACH HOUR"
FROM hacker_news
WHERE timestamp IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
